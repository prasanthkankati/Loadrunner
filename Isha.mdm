Web services like login, browse products, add to cart, checkout and logout services.

SOAP: SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. Itâ€™s a messaging protocol used for exchanging structured information between systems
over a network, typically HTTP.

Think of it like this:

SOAP is like a strict courier service that wraps your message in an envelope (XML format) and ensures it follows formal rules before delivering it.
| Feature   | SOAP                          | REST                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Format    | XML only                      | JSON, XML, etc.               |
| Protocol  | Strict (uses only HTTP, SMTP) | Flexible (HTTP-based)         |
| Speed     | Slower (verbose)              | Faster (lightweight)          |
| Standards | Strict standards (WSDL, XSD)  | No standard contract          |
| Usage     | Enterprise apps, B2B          | Web APIs, mobile, modern apps |
